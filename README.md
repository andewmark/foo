Introduction

Our newest development is an app that allows college students to get access to the
stuff they need and sell the stuff they no longer need. Our app plans for every university
to have their own subcommunity within the app allowing students when they download
the app to register within their own college. In our app, we want to maintain safe
measures which is why we plan to implement a verification system through college
emails and IDs ensuring that everyone who is selling or buying on the app is a college
student with a .edu account. We plan to include a rating system and a chat system so
that buyers and sellers know who they are talking to and their reputation. The Software
Requirements Specification is intended to outline the software requirements for the
Student Marketplace and provide guidance to the developers of the system to
implement all required functionality. It is also intended to guide all development for all
required testing plans and procedures for the testing team.


Purpose

The Student U Market Place is intended for Students at Universities / Colleges so it
minimizes waste during move-out periods. Our typical user is a college student who is
looking to get rid of the items they donâ€™t need, but at the same time helping them find
buyers who are willing to pay them for it. It will act like an online yard sale. On the other
hand, it will help buyers who are also college students, find items for cheaper rates than
other platforms.


Target Users

This app is targeting college students who would like to buy or purchase items from
fellow college students.


Scope

This document specifies the requirements for the following capabilities:
User Registration: Allow users to register with their college email and student ID
for verification purposes.
User Profile: Users should be able to create and manage their profiles, including
adding a profile picture, bio, and other relevant information.
Item Listings: Enable users to create listings for items they want to sell, including
descriptions, photos, and pricing.
Search and Filter: Implement a robust search functionality with filters to help
users find specific items quickly.
Wishlist: Allow users to add items to a wishlist for future reference.
Recommendations: Provide personalized recommendations based on users'
browsing and purchase history.
Messaging System: Enable direct messaging between buyers and sellers to
facilitate communication and negotiation.
Rating and Review System: Implement a system for users to rate and review
each other after transactions, fostering trust and transparency within the
community.


Feasibility

This app shows the high potential of being feasible and easily adaptable because there
already exist apps that perform a similar function to it. The only difference is that this
app is narrowing its scope to college students.
Economically, the users of this app are the ones who will be handling payments
therefore it takes off the burden of having a third party managing payments:
- The creators of this app will be making money through ads that other retailers
might want to promote within the app.
